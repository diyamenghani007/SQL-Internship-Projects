# SQL Internship Projects – Elevate Labs (June 2025 - July 2025)

This repository contains a collection of two production-grade SQL projects completed as part of my **SQL Developer Internship at Elevate Labs**. These projects simulate real-world scenarios ranging from retail operations to data pipeline simulations in an e-learning platform. The work demonstrates hands-on skills in **database design**, **ETL pipelines**, **data cleaning**, **audit logging**, and **business analytics** using **MySQL Workbench**.


## Internship Overview

**Internship Duration:** June 2025 - July 2025
**Organization:** Elevate Labs
**Role:** SQL Developer  


As part of the internship, I undertook two portfolio projects with end-to-end implementation including:

- Database schema design and normalization
- Sample data generation and transformation
- ETL simulation using SQL (no external tools)
- Business-focused analytical queries
- Realistic audit tracking via triggers
- Report writing and documentation

These projects are designed to reflect industry-standard data engineering and analytics workflows.


## Projects Included

### 1. Retail Sales Database Design

A comprehensive SQL database modeling project for an online retail store. The system includes customer, product, order, and payment modules and supports operational and analytical needs.

#### Key Components

* Fully normalized schema (3NF) with ER diagram
* Realistic sample data for all entities
* Complex SQL queries for business KPIs
* Analytical views for reporting
* Insight generation across revenue, product sales, payment methods, and customer value


#### 📘 Files Included

| File                                                | Description                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Retail Sales Database Design.sql`                  | Full DDL + DML script        |
| `Sample Data - Retail Sales Database Design.sql`    | Data-only script             |
| `Query Outputs - Retail Sales Database Design.docx` | Output of analytical queries |
| `Retail Sales Database Design Project Report.docx`  | Detailed project report      |
| `Retail Sales Database ER.drawio.html`              | Interactive ER Diagram       |


#### Learnings

* Practical experience with database normalization
* Business-driven SQL reporting and analytics
* Design of reusable analytical views
* Structured project documentation for stakeholders


### 2️. SQL ETL Pipeline Simulation for E-Learning Platform

A simulation of an ETL workflow entirely within SQL using MySQL Workbench. The project demonstrates the transformation of unstructured CSV data into a normalized schema with audit logging and insight extraction.

#### 🔧 Key Components

* Import and clean raw `.csv` data using a staging table
* Transformation: ratings, prices, durations, certifications
* Trigger-based audit logging (INSERT and UPDATE tracking)
* Final normalized `courses` table
* Insightful SQL queries over cleaned data

#### Insightful Queries Included

* Top Enrolled Courses
* Average Rating by Category
* Paid vs Free Course Distribution
* Top Instructors by Rating
* High-Rated Courses by Platform

#### Files Included

| File                                      | Description                |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `online_courses.csv`                      | Raw dataset                |
| `cleaned_courses.csv`                     | Transformed final data     |
| `audit_log.csv`                           | Insert/update log          |
| `ETL Pipeline Simulation.sql`             | Complete SQL script        |
| `Analytical Query Outputs.docx`           | Business queries output    |
| `SQL ETL Pipeline Simulation Report.docx` | Full project documentation |


#### Learnings

- End-to-end SQL ETL implementation
- Trigger-based change tracking
- Data cleansing & transformation in SQL
- Clear distinction between staging and production tables
- Analytical SQL for platform performance


## Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL Workbench**
- **SQL (DDL, DML, Views, Triggers, Joins, Aggregates)**
- **draw\.io** – ER Diagrams
- **MS Word / CSV Exports** – Reporting & Data Outputs


## Core Skills Demonstrated

- SQL Query Optimization
- Data Cleaning & ETL Simulation
- Audit Trail Creation using Triggers
- Schema Design & Normalization (up to 3NF)
- Business Query Writing for Analytics
- Professional Documentation & Reporting


## Key Takeaways

> "This repository reflects not just SQL proficiency, but also the ability to model business systems, clean and prepare real-world datasets, and build reusable analytical foundations for decision-making. Each file is built with clarity, reproducibility, and stakeholder value in mind."
